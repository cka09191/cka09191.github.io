  I'll post about quantum mechanics for a few weeks to summarize my study in university. The content of these posts will serve as a foundation for future discussions and posts on the topic of quantum information.

The primary goal of this series is to establish a robust 'second brain' by employing the Zettelkasten method. While focusing on this, I'll ensure the content remains accessible and engaging, allowing for concepts to be discussed interactively and understood with ease by all readers.
