  Introducing a series of posts on thermal radiation.

I'm planning a series of posts on thermal radiation, each covering a key topic:

- **[Wave-Particle Duality of Light](https://cka09191.github.io/Wave-Particle-Duality-of-Light/)**: This post sets the foundation by exploring light's dual nature, a basic concept for understanding thermal radiation.

- **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: Building on the concept of light's duality, this post delves into how temperature influences thermal radiation's energy, laying the groundwork for understanding its intensity and distribution.

- **Spectrum Energy Density**: Next, we'll look at how the energy of thermal radiation is influenced not just by temperature but also by light's frequency, creating a bridge to the concept of radiation pressure.

- **Radiation Pressure**: Following the discussion on energy density, this post explores how radiation manifests as pressure and how this pressure is intricately connected to the spectrum energy density, demonstrating the tangible effects of these theoretical concepts.

- **Kirchhoff's Law of Thermal Radiation**: Continuing from radiation pressure, we'll examine how different materials emit light in wave form, using Kirchhoff's Law to connect the dots between emission, absorption, and thermal radiation.

- **Emission of Photon**: Transitioning from wave-based emission to particle-based, this post discusses how materials emit light as photons, guided by Einstein's A and B coefficients.

- **Black Body Radiation**: Culminating the series, we explore the idealized concept of a black body in thermal radiation, linking it back to the cosmic microwave background data, and tying together all the concepts discussed in previous posts.


This series is interconnected each. Revisiting the descriptions above will enhance your cohesive understanding of the series.
