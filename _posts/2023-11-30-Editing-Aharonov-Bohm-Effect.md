feature_text: |
  The Aharonov-Bohm effect reveals that in quantum mechanics, potentials have a real effect on charged particles, even in regions where there are no electromagnetic fields or forces acting. This stands in contrast to classical physics, which does not attribute any physical significance to potentials in the absence of fields.

With a solenoid present:

Around the solenoid, there exists a [vector potential](https://cka09191.github.io/Fundamental-Concepts-in-Electromagnetics) in the direction of $\widehat\phi$(blue arrows), and inside the solenoid, there's a constant magnetic field in the direction of $\widehat z$(red arrows).

Considering the [Hamiltonian that includes the Lorentz force](https://cka09191.github.io/Fundamental-Concepts-in-Electromagnetics) within the solenoid:
$$\mathcal{H}=\frac{1}{2m} (\mathbf{p}-q \mathbf{A})^{2}+V$$

we can proceed to apply the Schr√∂dinger equation:
